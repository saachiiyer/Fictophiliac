        <hr />
        <p>The Young Adult (YA) genre is a category of literature written for readers typically aged between 12 and 18. However, its readership often extends beyond this age group, with many adults also enjoying YA novels. It's less defined by specific genre elements (like fantasy or romance) and more by the intended audience and the themes it commonly explores.</p>
